    We are not responsible for stolen passwords, dead SD cards,
    thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the files got wiped. Please
    do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this app
    before installing it! YOU are choosing to install this application, and if
    you point the finger at us for messing up your files, We will laugh at you. 
        
    A lot.

Make sure to write your name and email id in format `Name<email>` in the license declaration above every file you make change to. 

You won't be able to claim the license for changes made by you unless you do that.

Also, take a look at [this guide](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html) before making changes in code. 

Existing code itself might not follow this, but you don't have to do same mistakes we did a year ago!

Vendors/Developers
----
The device vendors/ROM developers are free to include Amaze apk pre-installed in system. There is no fee required, neither are any royality/credits elsewhere.

We strongly recommend using apk signed by us (either Play Store version or from AFH link above) so that users would be able to update directly from Play Store after distribution. Furthermore, a change in digital signature will break certain critical features too. 
    
Lastly, just to remind, license allows distribution only when source is not modified. If you do modify our code, you must make it open-source somewhere before distributing.
