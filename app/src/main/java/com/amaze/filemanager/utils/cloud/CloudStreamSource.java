   * You may notice a strange name for the smb input stream. I made some modifications to the
   * original one in the jcifs library for my needs, but streaming required returning to the
   * original one so I renamed it to "old". However, I needed to specify a buffer size in the
   * constructor. It looks now like this:
   *
   * <p>public SmbFileInputStreamOld( SmbFile file, int readBuffer, int openFlags) throws
   * SmbException, MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException { this.file = file; this.openFlags =
   * SmbFile.O_RDONLY & 0xFFFF; this.access = (openFlags >>> 16) & 0xFFFF; if (file.type !=
   * SmbFile.TYPE_NAMED_PIPE) { file.open( openFlags, access, SmbFile.ATTR_NORMAL, 0 );
   * this.openFlags &= ~(SmbFile.O_CREAT | SmbFile.O_TRUNC); } else { file.connect0(); } readSize =
   * readBuffer; fs = file.length(); }
   *
   * <p>Setting buffer size by properties didn't work for me so I created this constructor. In the
   * libs folder there is a library modified by me. If you want to use a stock one, you have to set
   * somehow the buffer size to be equal with http server's buffer size which is 8192.
